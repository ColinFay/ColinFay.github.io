Turning online bookdown into epub with some lines of code. 

So, let's start by stating this: 

+ {bookdown} is awesome (like, really awesome)
 
+ No one can read on a laptop on the beach

+ Everybody likes to read on the beach

How can I read bookdowns on the beach ? The answer is simple: ebook reader. But the thing is, bookdown authors do not always provide there bookdown as a downloadable ebook. So here's a little how to: 

```{r}
tmp_dir <- file.path(tempdir(), "bd")
git2r::clone("https://github.com/moderndive/moderndive_book", tmp_dir)
list.files(tmp_dir)
lapply(list.files(tmp_dir, full.names = TRUE), 
       function(x){
         a <- readLines(x)
         grep("library", a, value = TRUE)
       })
```
