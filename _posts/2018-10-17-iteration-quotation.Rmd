Ok, I admit, this will be a post about iteration and quotation, but that would have made a less attractive title don't you think? ;) 

## Using tidyeval and {purrr}

The question poped on the [ThinkR]() slack lately: why isn't this code working? (Well, it wasn't this code, but something that looked like it).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

df <- mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg:disp)

my_graph <- function(tbl, which){
  tbl %>% 
    ggplot()+
    aes(x = !! enquo(which) ) +
    geom_density()
}

map(mtcars, ~ my)
map( 1:2, )

```
