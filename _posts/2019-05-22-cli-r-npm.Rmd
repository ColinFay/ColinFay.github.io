How to build a CLI for R, with npm. 

## Background 

This blog post was triggered by a discussion on Twitter with [Martin Skarzynski](https://twitter.com/_ColinFay/status/1131205018068160515), who was looking for a way to build a CLI that launches an RScript. Here's a way to do this using `npm`.

Please note that this blog post won't teach you how to build the command line tool, it will quickly go over the way to create a system-wide command line interface, using npm. 

If you want to learn more about building the utility, see this [fantastic series of blog posts](https://blog.sellorm.com/2017/12/18/learn-to-write-command-line-utilities-in-r/) by Mark Sellor. 

Now, the idea is to have a CLI, i.e. a way to launch your utility with:

```
$ mytool
```

And that, system-wide.

## What you'll need 

+ An R script (script.R) with in it, for example:

```
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript --vanilla
cli::cat_rule("yeay")
cli::cat_bullet(Sys.time())
```

+ `npm`, which you can get from [there](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). 

## Let's go

Create a new folder, and go inside it.

```
mkdir cli && cd cli
```

Create the R Script there.

```
echo '#!/usr/bin/env Rscript --vanilla' > script.R
echo 'cli::cat_rule("yeay")' >> script.R
echo 'cli::cat_bullet(Sys.time())' >> script.R
```

Try your script to see if it works:

```
Rscript script.R
```

Now launch an npm project: 

```
npm init -y
```

(You can also run it without the `-y` to interactively add information to the `package.json`.)

Now the important part: add a `"bin"` value in the `package.json`, with the name of the bin you want to create, and the path to the script, relatively to the package file. Here is an example of a `package.json` (I removed some elements).

```
{
  "name": "cli",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "CLI example with npm",
  "bin" : {
    "clir" : "./script.R"
  },
  "author": "Colin Fay",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Install it globally (need sudo rights): 

```
sudo npm link
```

And, voil√†! Open your terminal, and you're done!

```{bash}
clir
```
