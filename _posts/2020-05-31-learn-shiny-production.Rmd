Hey Shiny devs of the world! 
I'm leading a training in July about building a Shiny application for production. 
It will be a 10 half-day session, with everything happening remotely, meaning that you can attend from anywhere in the world `r emo::ji('tada')`. 

During this online workshop, I'll share a lot of what we know about building a robust Shiny application that is ready to be sent to production: `{golem}`, prototyping, modules, reactivity, a little bit of JavaScript for Shiny, and how and where to deploy your application once it's ready. 

I'm very excited about this training as it will cover a lot of the things we've been working on for the past months, and will guide you towards being a better Shiny programmer. 
And on top of that, we will be working on our brand new online e-learning platform, which I've been developing since the beginning of 2020 (and I'm sure you will enjoy it!).

We still have a couple of tickets left to this session, so if you want to know more, and register, please visit [Learning Shiny for Production â€“ Remote session](https://rtask.thinkr.fr/remote-trainings-and-certification/learning-shiny-online-july/).

See you there!
