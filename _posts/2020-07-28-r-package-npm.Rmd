```

I'm a big fan of how dependencies are managed in the NodeJS world, be it internally when developing, or when it comes to where they are hosted (_i.e_ via npm, the Node Package Manager).
Of course it has its downside (that I won't be talking about here), but from a developer point of view the easiness of publication and installation is really nice. 

While building [hordes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hordes), a NodeJS module that interacts with R, I wanted to add a way to automatically install the companion R package when installing the Node module from npm. 
And when I found how to, I thought: hey, maybe we can generalize that for any R package!

## First of all, why would you want to do that? 

Well, because why not? 

And also, because the easiness of publication offers a rapid way to publish online an R package that you need to send to production: for example, if you have an R package that needs to be installed in a Docker image that you want to send to prod NOW, CRAN is not a solution, passing a tar.gz works but means you have to share the tar.gz with the Dockerfile, and it can feel weird to install stuffs from GitHub, even more if you want to be sure to install a fixed version. 
Plus there is always the issue of GitHub API rate limit, that you can bypass by setting a personal token, but that means that your token is passed to the container.

Anyway, I wanted to see if I could use npm as a platform for publishing an R package, whatever the excuse/reason you want to find for doing that. 

## Setting the `package.json`

So I took my `{dockerstats}` package ([github.com/ColinFay/dockerstats](https://github.com/ColinFay/dockerstats)), as an example of a package I'll push to npm. 

The first thing you need to do when you build a Node module is to add a file called `package.json`. 
To do that, go to your package folder and run in your terminal `npm init -y`. 
That command will add the default file in your working directory. 

This is what the default `package.json` file looks like:

```
{
  "name": "dockerstats",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "<!-- README.md is generated from README.Rmd. Please edit that file -->",
  "main": "index.js",
  "directories": {
    "man": "man",
    "test": "tests"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/ColinFay/dockerstats.git"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "bugs": {
    "url": "https://github.com/ColinFay/dockerstats/issues"
  },
  "homepage": "https://github.com/ColinFay/dockerstats#readme"
}
```

Kind of nice of npm to have matched the git info (and apparently the first line of the Readme.md). 

Next step, add this file to the `.Rbuildignore`, so it doesn't return an error at check. 

```bash
Rscript -e "usethis::use_build_ignore('package.json')"
âœ” Setting active project to 'XXX/R/opensource/dockerstats'
âœ” Adding '^package\\.json$' to '.Rbuildignore'
```

Now, let's complete the JSON file with what we will need: updating the description, adding an author, changing the license... and of course, the most important thing: adding a script to install the R package. 
This last part will be performed with the `postinstall` command available in the `"scripts"` entry: the command contained here will be run after the Node module is "installed" (here, nothing related to Node will be installed, we're just using the structure for this postinstall behavior). 

```json
{
    "name": "r-dockerstats",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "description": "`{dockerstats}` is a small wrapper around `docker stats` that returns the output of this command as an R data.frame. ",
    "directories": {
        "man": "man",
        "test": "tests"
    },
    "scripts": {
        "test": "Rscript -e 'devtools::check()'",
        "compile-readme": "Rscript -e 'knitr::knit(\"Readme.Rmd\")'",
        "postinstall": "Rscript -e 'source(\"install.R\")'"
    },
    "repository": {
        "type": "git",
        "url": "git+https://github.com/ColinFay/dockerstats.git"
    },
    "keywords": [
        "RStats",
        "Docker"
    ],
    "author": "Colin Fay <contact@colinfay.me> (https://colinfay.me)",
    "license": "MIT",
    "bugs": {
        "url": "https://github.com/ColinFay/dockerstats/issues"
    },
    "homepage": "https://github.com/ColinFay/dockerstats#readme"
}
```

What is R specific to this `package.json`:

+ `test` calls `devtools::check()`, so I can run this command by doing `npm test`
+ `compile-readme` will knit the README.Rmd into its md counterpart, I can call it using `npm run compile-readme`
+ `postinstall` will launch R and source the script below, inserted in the project

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript --vanilla

installr <- function(){
    # Creating a directory where to install {remotes} in case it's
    # not already on the machine, and remove this 
    # directory when the function exits
    dir.create("rtemplib")
    on.exit(unlink("rtemplib", TRUE, TRUE))

    if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)){
        # If {remotes} is not found, we install it inside the temp lib
        install.packages("remotes", lib = "rtemplib", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
        library(remotes, lib.loc = "rtemplib")
    } else {
        # {remotes} was found on the machine, load it
        library(remotes)
    }
    # Install the local directory on the machine
    install_local()

}

installr()
```

And of course, don't forget to add this script to the buildigore:

```bash
Rscript -e "usethis::use_build_ignore('install.R')"
âœ” Adding '^install\.R$' to '.Rbuildignore'
```

Let's start by trying to install the package locally (_i.e_ not from npm but from our local machine)

```bash
# Removing {dockerstats}
$ Rscript -e "remove.packages('dockerstats')"
Removing package from â€˜/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.6/Resources/libraryâ€™

# Trying to load it fails
$ Rscript -e "library(dockerstats)"

Execution halted

# Installing the local package (we are in the {dockerstats} root directory)
$ npm install

That seems to work, let's try to push it to npm.

Yeay! [https://www.npmjs.com/package/r-dockerstats](https://www.npmjs.com/package/r-dockerstats). 
That was also blazing fast (just a couple of seconds). 

Can we really install it from npm now?

Nice! 

Some note on the install: 

+ I used `npm install -g`, because it will install via the "global" node module folder. 
If I hadn't used this flag, I would have first needed to init an npm project in the current folder. 

+ To meet production standards, I should also use `npm install -g r-dockerstats@0.1.0`, so that I have the fixed version. 

## Install Node on your machine

Of course, before trying it yourself, you'll need to install NodeJS, which will bundle npm with it. 

The [Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page from NodeJS comes with a series of installers that you might find handy.
